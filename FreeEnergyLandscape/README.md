## Theoretical Background

The free energy landscape is a conceptual and computational tool used to understand the energetics and dynamics of molecular systems. It is particularly useful in the study of complex processes such as protein folding, chemical reactions, and phase transitions.

### Collective Variables (CVs)


Collective Variables (CVs) are a set of coordinates that describe the macroscopic state of a system. They are used to reduce the complexity of molecular systems by focusing on the relevant degrees of freedom. Examples include the distance between two atoms, angles, dihedrals, and more complex descriptors. 

The use of distance and angle as CVs in this study serves merely as an example to illustrate the tool's capabilities. However, it's important to note that the input can be any file containing two columns: the first for frames and the second for the value of the collective variable. This flexibility allows the tool to be applicable to a wide range of studies involving different types of collective variables

CVs in biomolecular systems are mathematically represented as functions of the atomic coordinates. These functions are designed to capture the essential features of the system's configuration that are relevant to its macroscopic properties or behaviors. Below are examples of commonly used CVs and their mathematical formulations:

1. **Distance**: The distance $d$ between two atoms $i$ and $j$ with positions $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$ can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:

   First, determine the position vectors of atoms $i$ and $j$:
   $$\vec{r}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)$$
   $$\vec{r}_j = (x_j, y_j, z_j)$$

   Then, calculate the distance $d$ as:
   $$d = |\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j| = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2}$$

   - $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$ are the position vectors of atoms $i$ and $j$, respectively.
   - $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ denote the Cartesian coordinates of atoms $i$ and $j$.
   - $|\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j|$ represents the magnitude of the vector difference between $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$, giving the direct distance between the two atoms.

2. **Angle**: The angle $\theta$ formed by three atoms $i$, $j$, and $k$, where $j$ is the vertex, can be calculated using the dot product:

   First, determine the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$:
   $$\vec{r}_ji = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j$$
   $$\vec{r}_jk = \vec{r}_k - \vec{r}_j$$

   Then, calculate the angle $\theta$ as:
   $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{r}_ji \cdot \vec{r}_jk}{|\vec{r}_ji| |\vec{r}_jk|}$$
   $$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{r}_ji \cdot \vec{r}_jk}{|\vec{r}_ji| |\vec{r}_jk|}\right)$$

   - $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$ are vectors pointing from atom $j$ to atoms $i$ and $k$, respectively.
   - $\cdot$ denotes the dot product between the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$.
   - $|\vec{r}_ji|$ and $|\vec{r}_jk|$ represent the magnitudes of the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$, respectively.
   - $\arccos$ is the inverse cosine function, used to find the angle $\theta$ from the cosine value.

These representations allow for a simplified description of the system's state, facilitating the study of its behavior and properties through the manipulation of a reduced set of variables rather than the full set of atomic coordinates.

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

This statistical method is crucial for estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a dataset without assuming any predefined distribution shape. In the context of molecular dynamics and simulations, it allows us to visualize and analyze the distribution of free energy across different states or configurations defined by collective variables (CVs).

The `gaussian_kde` leverages a Gaussian (normal) distribution, placing it at each point in the dataset and summing these distributions to approximate the overall data's PDF. This technique is adept at capturing the underlying structure of the data, providing a smooth, continuous representation of the free energy landscape. The smoothness of the KDE is controlled by the bandwidth parameter, which determines the width of the Gaussian kernels used.

Mathematically, the density estimation at a point $`x`$ is calculated as follows:

$$\ f(x) = \frac{1}{n \cdot h} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K(u) \$$   

where:
- $K(u)$ represents the Gaussian kernel function

$$ K(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2} $$

- $u$ is the normalized distance

$$ u = \frac{x - x_i}{h} $$

- $n$ is the number of data points
- $h$ is the bandwidth
- $x$ is where the density is being estimated
- $x_i$ are the data points
  
note that:
- $u^2$ is the square of this normalized distance, which serves to weight the contribution of each data point $x_i$ to the density estimate at $x$, based on how far $x_i$ is from $x$, adjusted by the bandwidth $h$.
- $e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2}$ decreases rapidly as $u$ increases, meaning that points further away from $x$ will have less influence on the density estimate at $x$.
- $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ is a normalization term that ensures the Gaussian kernel function integrates to $1$, keeping it as a valid probability distribution.

In the context of KDE the variable $u$ is utilized within the Gaussian kernel function $K$, which is a probability density function. Thus, $u$ is crucial in determining how the distance between $x$ and the data points $x_i$ affects the density estimate at $x$, with the bandwidth $h$ controlling the sensitivity of this influence.

The Gaussian KDE method provides a sophisticated approach to model the complex free energy landscapes encountered in molecular dynamics studies. It enables researchers to visualize the distribution of energy states without the constraints of parametric models, offering insights into molecular stability, transitions, and the energetics of molecular interactions.

### Boltzmann distribution

The Boltzmann distribution relates the energy of a state to its probability in a canonical ensemble, this provides a fundamental link between the microstate probabilities of a thermodynamic system and its macroscopic properties. It expresses the probability $P$ of a system being in a state with a certain free energy $\Delta G$ at a specific temperature $T$:

$$P \propto e^{-\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}}$$

where:
- $P$ is the probability of observing the state,
- $\Delta G$ represents the free energy difference of that state relative to a chosen reference state,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, a fundamental physical constant that relates energy scales to temperature,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the system, measured in Kelvin.

### Normalization of Probability

For the concept of probability to be meaningful in the context of statistical mechanics, it's imperative that the probabilities of all conceivable states sum to unity. This requirement ensures that the predicted behavior encompasses all possible configurations of the system. Consider a state that represents the maximum free energy, denoted as $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$, its corresponding maximum probability, $P_{\text{max}}$, can be analogously expressed through the Boltzmann factor.

### From Proportionality to Quantitative Relationship

To quantitatively relate $\Delta G$ with $P$ and $P_{\text{max}}$, we proceed as follows:

1. Express $P$ as a function of $\Delta G$:

   $$P = e^{-\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}}$$

2. Similarly, express $P_{\text{max}}$ as a function of $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$:

   $$P_{\text{max}} = e^{-\frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}}$$

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides of these expressions yields:

$$\ln(P) = -\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}$$

$$\ln(P_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}$$

Subtracting the equation for $\ln(P_{\text{max}})$ from the equation for $\ln(P)$ removes the dependency on the reference state $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$, leading to:

$$\ln(P) - \ln(P_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T} + \frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}$$

Given the interest in determining the free energy difference $\Delta G$ relative to the state with maximum probability $P_{\text{max}}$, we can rearrange this relationship to solve explicitly for $\Delta G$:

$$\Delta G = -k_B T (\ln(P) - \ln(P_{\text{max}}))$$

The Gibbs free energy provides a measure of the amount of "useful work" that can be obtained from a thermodynamic system in a process at constant temperature and pressure. Here, $\Delta G$ is expressed as a function of the difference in the logarithms of the probabilities of finding the system in any state versus the state of highest probability (or lowest free energy), multiplied by the system's absolute temperature and the Boltzmann constant. This relationship shows how the free energy difference between two states can be calculated from their relative probabilities, providing a direct bridge between statistical thermodynamics and experimental observations or computational simulations.

This relationship allows us to convert a histogram of CV values into a free energy surface and this formulation also adjusts the free energy values so that the minimum energy associated with the highest probability $P_{\text{max}}$ is set to 0. This expression quantitatively links the probability distribution of states within a thermodynamic system to their respective free energy differences, providing a foundation for analyzing the system's behavior at the molecular level and this approach is useful for highlighting the relative differences in free energy between different states or conformations in an MD simulation, facilitating the identification of free energy minima and the relative comparison between different states. By setting the minimum of free energy to 0, this create a clear reference point to evaluate the relative stability of other states compared to the most stable state.
