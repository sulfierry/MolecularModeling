## Theoretical Background

The free energy landscape is a conceptual and computational tool used to understand the energetics and dynamics of molecular systems. It is particularly useful in the study of complex processes such as protein folding, chemical reactions, and phase transitions.

### Collective Variables (CVs)

Collective Variables (CVs) are a set of coordinates that describe the macroscopic state of a system. They are used to reduce the complexity of molecular systems by focusing on the relevant degrees of freedom. Examples include the analysis of principal components (PCA), the distance between two atoms, angles, dihedrals, and more complex descriptors. Below are examples of commonly used CVs and their mathematical formulations.

The inclusion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an example of CVs is crucial for understanding the dimensional reduction in complex systems. PCA identifies the directions (principal components) along which the variance in the data is maximized. In the context of CVs, the first two principal components, denoted as $PC_1$ and $PC_2$, serve as collective variables that capture the most significant modes of variation within the system. Mathematically, PCA transforms the original data into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables with weights given by the eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix.

PCA is an algebraic procedure that transforms a number of (possibly) correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the highest possible variance (it accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. The components are orthogonal because they are the eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$, which is a symmetric matrix.

So, $\mathbf{X}$ is a $n \times p$ data matrix representing $n$ observations with $p$ variables, the goal of PCA is to transform $\mathbf{X}$ into a new coordinate system through a linear transformation that maps $\mathbf{X}$ onto a new set of variables, the principal components (PCs), which are linear combinations of the original variables. This is achieved by eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{n-1} \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}$, or more commonly through singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\mathbf{X}$.

Geometrically, PCA seeks the line (in the case of a single principal component) or hyperplane (in the case of multiple principal components) that best captures the distribution of the data in a high-dimensional space. The first principal component is the direction along which the projection of the data points has the largest variance. This direction corresponds to the eigenvector of the covariance matrix associated with the largest eigenvalue. The second principal component is orthogonal to the first and represents the direction of the next highest variance, corresponding to the eigenvector associated with the second largest eigenvalue, and so on.

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Can be expressed as:
$$PC_k = \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_{ki}X_i$$
where $PC_k$ is the $k_{th}$ principal component, $X_i$ are the original variables, and $a_{ki}$ are the coefficients (loadings) for the $k_{th}$ principal component, given by the $k_{th}$ eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$. The transformation can be represented in matrix form as:
$$\mathbf{PC} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{A}$$
where $\mathbf{PC}$ is the matrix of principal components, $\mathbf{X}$ is the original data matrix (centered or standardized, if necessary), and $\mathbf{A}$ is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{C}$.

This algebraic and geometric perspective highlights the essence of PCA as a method for identifying the directions (in the space of the original variables) that maximize the variance of the projected data, thereby reducing its dimensionality while preserving as much of the original data's variation as possible.

2. **Angle**: The angle $\theta$ formed by three atoms $i$, $j$, and $k$, where $j$ is the vertex, can be calculated using the dot product:

   First, determine the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$:
   $$\vec{r}_ji = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j$$
   $$\vec{r}_jk = \vec{r}_k - \vec{r}_j$$

   Then, calculate the angle $\theta$ as:
   $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{r}_ji \cdot \vec{r}_jk}{|\vec{r}_ji| |\vec{r}_jk|}$$
   $$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{r}_ji \cdot \vec{r}_jk}{|\vec{r}_ji| |\vec{r}_jk|}\right)$$

   - $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$ are vectors pointing from atom $j$ to atoms $i$ and $k$, respectively.
   - $\cdot$ denotes the dot product between the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$.
   - $|\vec{r}_ji|$ and $|\vec{r}_jk|$ represent the magnitudes of the vectors $\vec{r}_ji$ and $\vec{r}_jk$, respectively.
   - $\arccos$ is the inverse cosine function, used to find the angle $\theta$ from the cosine value.
  

3. **Distance**: The distance $d$ between two atoms $i$ and $j$ with positions $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$ can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:

   First, determine the position vectors of atoms $i$ and $j$:
   $$\vec{r}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)$$
   $$\vec{r}_j = (x_j, y_j, z_j)$$

   Then, calculate the distance $d$ as:
   $$d = |\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j| = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2}$$

   - $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$ are the position vectors of atoms $i$ and $j$, respectively.
   - $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ denote the Cartesian coordinates of atoms $i$ and $j$.
   - $|\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j|$ represents the magnitude of the vector difference between $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{r}_j$, giving the direct distance between the two atoms.

Following PCA, the use of distance and angle as CVs in this study serves as an example to illustrate the tool's capabilities. However, it's important to note that the input can be any file containing two columns: the first for frames and the second for the value of the collective variable. This flexibility allows the tool to be applicable to a wide range of studies involving different types of collective variables.

These representations allow for a simplified description of the system's state, facilitating the study of its behavior and properties through the manipulation of a reduced set of variables rather than the full set of atomic coordinates.

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

This statistical method is crucial for estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a dataset without assuming any predefined distribution shape. In the context of molecular dynamics and simulations, it allows us to visualize and analyze the distribution of free energy across different states or configurations defined by collective variables (CVs).

The `gaussian_kde` leverages a Gaussian (normal) distribution, placing it at each point in the dataset and summing these distributions to approximate the overall data's PDF. This technique is adept at capturing the underlying structure of the data, providing a smooth, continuous representation of the free energy landscape. The smoothness of the KDE is controlled by the bandwidth parameter, which determines the width of the Gaussian kernels used.

Mathematically, the density estimation at a point $`x`$ is calculated as follows:

$$\ f(x) = \frac{1}{n \cdot h} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K(u) \$$   

where:
- $K(u)$ represents the Gaussian kernel function

$$ K(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2} $$

- $u$ is the normalized distance

$$ u = \frac{x - x_i}{h} $$

- $n$ is the number of data points
- $h$ is the bandwidth
- $x$ is where the density is being estimated
- $x_i$ are the data points
  
note that:
- $u^2$ is the square of this normalized distance, which serves to weight the contribution of each data point $x_i$ to the density estimate at $x$, based on how far $x_i$ is from $x$, adjusted by the bandwidth $h$.
- $e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2}$ decreases rapidly as $u$ increases, meaning that points further away from $x$ will have less influence on the density estimate at $x$.
- $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ is a normalization term that ensures the Gaussian kernel function integrates to $1$, keeping it as a valid probability distribution.

In the context of KDE the variable $u$ is utilized within the Gaussian kernel function $K$, which is a probability density function. Thus, $u$ is crucial in determining how the distance between $x$ and the data points $x_i$ affects the density estimate at $x$, with the bandwidth $h$ controlling the sensitivity of this influence.

The Gaussian KDE method provides a sophisticated approach to model the complex free energy landscapes encountered in molecular dynamics studies. It enables researchers to visualize the distribution of energy states without the constraints of parametric models, offering insights into molecular stability, transitions, and the energetics of molecular interactions.

### Boltzmann distribution

The Boltzmann distribution relates the energy of a state to its probability in a canonical ensemble, this provides a fundamental link between the microstate probabilities of a thermodynamic system and its macroscopic properties. It expresses the probability $P$ of a system being in a state with a certain free energy $\Delta G$ at a specific temperature $T$:

$$P \propto e^{-\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}}$$

where:
- $P$ is the probability of observing the state,
- $\Delta G$ represents the free energy difference of that state relative to a chosen reference state,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, a fundamental physical constant that relates energy scales to temperature,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the system, measured in Kelvin.

### Normalization of Probability

For the concept of probability to be meaningful in the context of statistical mechanics, it's imperative that the probabilities of all conceivable states sum to unity. This requirement ensures that the predicted behavior encompasses all possible configurations of the system. Consider a state that represents the maximum free energy, denoted as $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$, its corresponding maximum probability, $P_{\text{max}}$, can be analogously expressed through the Boltzmann factor.

### From Proportionality to Quantitative Relationship

To quantitatively relate $\Delta G$ with $P$ and $P_{\text{max}}$, we proceed as follows:

1. Express $P$ as a function of $\Delta G$:

   $$P = e^{-\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}}$$

2. Similarly, express $P_{\text{max}}$ as a function of $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$:

   $$P_{\text{max}} = e^{-\frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}}$$

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides of these expressions yields:

$$\ln(P) = -\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T}$$

$$\ln(P_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}$$

Subtracting the equation for $\ln(P_{\text{max}})$ from the equation for $\ln(P)$ removes the dependency on the reference state $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$, leading to:

$$\ln(P) - \ln(P_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{\Delta G}{k_B T} + \frac{\Delta G_{\text{max}}}{k_B T}$$

Given the interest in determining the free energy difference $\Delta G$ relative to the state with maximum probability $P_{\text{max}}$, we can rearrange this relationship to solve explicitly for $\Delta G$:

$$\Delta G = -k_B T (\ln(P) - \ln(P_{\text{max}}))$$

The Gibbs free energy provides a measure of the amount of "useful work" that can be obtained from a thermodynamic system in a process at constant temperature and pressure. Here, $\Delta G$ is expressed as a function of the difference in the logarithms of the probabilities of finding the system in any state versus the state of highest probability (or lowest free energy), multiplied by the system's absolute temperature and the Boltzmann constant. This relationship shows how the free energy difference between two states can be calculated from their relative probabilities, providing a direct bridge between statistical thermodynamics and experimental observations or computational simulations.

This relationship allows us to convert a histogram of CV values into a free energy surface and this formulation also adjusts the free energy values so that the minimum energy associated with the highest probability $P_{\text{max}}$ is set to 0. This expression quantitatively links the probability distribution of states within a thermodynamic system to their respective free energy differences, providing a foundation for analyzing the system's behavior at the molecular level and this approach is useful for highlighting the relative differences in free energy between different states or conformations in an MD simulation, facilitating the identification of free energy minima and the relative comparison between different states. By setting the minimum of free energy to 0, this create a clear reference point to evaluate the relative stability of other states compared to the most stable state.

# Comparative Analysis of Free Energy Calculation Methods

This document provides a detailed mathematical comparison of free energy calculation and interpolation methods between the custom Python script `freeEnergyLandscape.py` and the method of GROMACS tools `gmx_sham` and `gmx_wham`.

# GMX SHAM Mechanism Description

The `gmx_sham` tool is part of the GROMACS suite, designed to analyze free energy landscapes from simulation data. The core functionality revolves around creating multidimensional histograms from the provided data and calculating the free energy landscape. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process, including the improved explanation of "accumulated probability of all data points":

## Data Preparation

1. **Extremes Determination**: For each eigenvector, the code calculates minimum and maximum values across all data points, adding a small buffer to ensure all data is encompassed (`find_extremes` function).

2. **Normalization and Volume Correction**: Data undergo normalization and volume correction if necessary, based on user-specified dimensions. This step adjusts the probability calculations for spatial dimensions, correcting for volume effects that increase with distance in 2D and 3D spaces, as seen in the `correct_for_volume_effects` method.

## Histogram Creation and Free Energy Calculation

1. **Binning**: Data is sorted into multidimensional bins, each representing specific intervals of the eigenvectors (`binning_data` function). Points are allocated to bins based on their eigenvector values.

2. **Accumulated Probability Calculation**: The accumulated probability ($P_{acum}(bin)$) for each bin is calculated as the number of data points within the bin ($(N_{bin})$) divided by the total number of data points ($(N_{total})$), reflecting the proportion of occurrences for each bin relative to the entire dataset.

$$P_{acum}(bin) = \frac{N_{bin}}{N_{total}}$$

3. **Free Energy Calculation**: Free energy ($G$) for each bin is determined using the inverse Boltzmann relation, where the accumulated probability informs the energy level:

$$G(bin) = -kT \ln(P_{acum}(bin))$$

   Here, ($k$) is Boltzmann's constant, and ($T$) is the system's temperature. This step is executed within the `calculate_free_energy` method.

4. **Probability Normalization and Energy Adjustment**: Finally, the probability in each bin is normalized, and the free energy values are adjusted so the minimum free energy across the landscape is set to zero, facilitating easier interpretation and visualization.


# GMX WHAM Mechanism Description

The `gmx_wham` tool within the GROMACS suite utilizes the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) to derive free energy landscapes from multiple simulations. This sophisticated statistical approach combines data from various histograms to estimate the system's free energy landscape accurately. Additionally, `gmx_wham` employs linear interpolation for handling tabulated potentials. Below is a detailed explanation of WHAM's process, incorporating the clarification regarding interpolation methods:

## Data Preparation and Histogram Creation

1. **Histogram Generation**: Each simulation dataset contributes a histogram based on a specific reaction coordinate, representing the frequency distribution of system states across the sampled parameter space.

2. **Bias Correction**: To effectively explore specific regions of the parameter space, simulations often apply a bias. WHAM corrects these biases across all histograms, ensuring equitable contributions to the final analysis.

## Statistical Combination and Free Energy Calculation

WHAM utilizes a statistical method to combine histograms and derive the free energy landscape:

1. **Combining Histograms**: The method combines biased histograms using iteratively adjusted weights. Each histogram's weight reflects its contribution to the overall free energy calculation, considering the applied bias during simulation.

2. **Iterative Solution**: WHAM solves a set of self-consistent equations to find the weights that maximize the likelihood of the combined histogram data:

   - Let $N_i(j)$ be the number of counts in the $j^{th}$ bin of the $i^{th}$ histogram, with $n_i$ total observations and a biasing energy $U_i(j)$.
   - The unbiased probability distribution $P(j)$ for the $j^{th}$ bin is estimated by:

$$P(j) = \frac{\sum_{i} N_i(j)}{\sum_{i} n_i \exp\left[-\beta (U_i(j) - F_i)\right]}$$

Here, $\beta = 1/(k_BT)$, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $F_i$ is the iteratively adjusted free energy of the $i^{th}$ simulation.

3. **Free Energy Landscape**: The free energy $G$ for each state is calculated from the probability distribution $P(j)$:

$$G(j) = -k_BT \ln(P(j))$$

   This reveals the energetically favorable states and barriers between them.

## Linear Interpolation for Tabulated Potentials

In addition to the statistical combination of histograms, `gmx_wham` uses linear interpolation within the `tabulated_pot` function for tabulated potentials. This method estimates potential energy values at intermediate distances, providing a continuous potential energy landscape.

However, this linear interpolation method is specifically applied to the scenario of dealing with tabulated potentials and does not directly influence the primary WHAM algorithm's statistical combination of histograms for free energy calculation. The WHAM methodology itself does not inherently use linear interpolation as part of its core algorithm for combining histograms or calculating the free energy landscape. Instead, WHAM relies on a statistical approach to optimally combine data from multiple biased simulations to reconstruct the unbiased free energy profile.


## Free Energy Landscape Calculation with Python Script

This document outlines the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Boltzmann Inversion by the `freeEnergyLandscape.py` script to estimate the free energy landscape of a system from its collective variables.

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Method

KDE smooths the distribution of collective variables to enhance the estimation of probability densities. It employs Scott's rule for bandwidth selection, ensuring an appropriately smooth density estimate for the data's scale.

$$
\text{Bandwidth (Scott's Rule)} = \sigma \cdot n^{-1/5}
$$

- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the sample.
- $n$ is the sample size.

KDE for a set of points is given by:

$$
\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{n \cdot h} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K\left( \frac{x - x_i}{h} \right)
$$

- $n$ is the number of points
- $K$ is the kernel function, typically Gaussian.
- $h$ is the bandwidth.

### Boltzmann Inversion

The free energy $G(x)$ of a state is calculated from the probability density $\hat{f}(x)$, obtained via KDE:

$$
G(x) = -k_BT \ln(\hat{f}(x))
$$

- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
- $T$ is the temperature.

### Probability Normalization

To ensure accurate energy calculation, the probability densities are normalized over the entire range of possible values, ensuring they sum to one across the configurational space:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(x) \, dx = 1
$$

### Interpolation

The smoothly interpolated probability density function provided by KDE enables calculating the free energy landscape over a continuous range of collective variable values, highlighting energetically favorable states and barriers between them.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while `gmx_sham` and `gmx_wham` are powerful tools for free energy analysis within the GROMACS environment, `freeEnergyLandscape.py` offers a more user-friendly and customizable approach, particularly beneficial for those seeking immediate visualization and flexible data analysis options.
