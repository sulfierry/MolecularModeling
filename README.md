# Comprehensive Repository for Molecular Studies

Welcome to this extensive repository designed to facilitate molecular studies, particularly focusing on database querying and molecular dynamics simulations. This repository is divided into two main sections: `ChEMBL` and `Molecular_dynamics`, each serving a unique purpose in the realm of computational chemistry and molecular biology.

## Directory Structure:

### ChEMBL:
This directory contains scripts and resources for effective querying and analysis of the ChEMBL database. ChEMBL is a rich resource of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. The scripts in this directory primarily focus on:

- **SQL Commands**: 
  - `SQL Scripts`: Tailored to extract meaningful data from the ChEMBL database, especially focusing on kinase inhibitors. Includes SQL queries for creating tables with specific criteria and exporting data to TSV format.
  - `Data Analysis and Processing`: Python scripts designed for post-processing of the extracted data. These scripts help in cleaning, analyzing, and preparing the data for further computational studies.

### Molecular_dynamics:
This directory contains detailed protocols and input files for molecular dynamics simulations. The protocols are crafted to ensure accurate and efficient simulation of molecular systems, particularly protein-ligand interactions.

- **Simulation Protocols**: 
  - Detailed step-by-step procedures for various stages of molecular dynamics simulations, including energy minimization, equilibration, and production runs.
  - Specific focus on ensuring system stability and realistic molecular behavior through various stages such as pre-relaxation, relaxation with different restraint levels, and long-term production phases in different ensembles.

- **Input Files**:
  - Contains essential input files for simulations, tailored according to the outlined protocols. These files are crucial for initiating and running simulations in molecular dynamics software.

## Repository Usage:

- **ChEMBL Directory**: Ideal for researchers needing to extract and process data from the ChEMBL database. The SQL scripts are designed to be user-friendly and customizable. Python scripts ensure that the data is cleaned and ready for further analysis or simulation.
- **Molecular_dynamics Directory**: Beneficial for those conducting molecular dynamics simulations, particularly in the field of drug discovery and protein-ligand interactions. The protocols provide a comprehensive guide, while the input files serve as a ready-to-use resource for simulations.
