1. **Molecular Dynamics Input (`molecular_dynamics_input`)**: 
   - `run.sh`: An example script demonstrating how to initiate a molecular dynamics simulation. It serves as a template for users to customize their simulations.
   - This sub-folder offers a guideline for setting up simulation inputs and parameters.
   - 
2. **System Replicate (`system_replicate`)**:
   - Contains all necessary input files and topology for the specific molecular system under study, exemplified by the PDB structure 5cc8.
   - Provides a ready-to-use setup for replicating the molecular dynamics simulation of the 5cc8 system.

3. **Input Files and Protocols**: 
   - Detailed protocols and input files (`*.in`) for each stage of the simulation are provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the process.
