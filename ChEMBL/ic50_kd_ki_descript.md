## Understanding \(K_d\), \(K_i\), and IC50 in Chemical and Computational Chemistry

In the fields of chemistry and computational chemistry, particularly in drug discovery, it is crucial to understand the interactions between small molecules (such as drugs) and biological targets (such as enzymes or receptors). Below are definitions and reasons for comparing certain measurements in this context:

### Definitions

- **\(K_d\) (Dissociation Constant)**: \(K_d\) is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of a ligand-receptor complex into free ligand and free receptor. It indicates the affinity of the ligand for the receptor, with lower values of \(K_d\) indicating higher affinity.

- **\(K_i\) (Inhibition Constant)**: \(K_i\) is a measure of how effectively an inhibitor binds to an enzyme or receptor site. It is also a measure of affinity, derived from biochemical assays that quantify an inhibitor's ability to compete with a natural substrate or ligand for binding to the active site.
